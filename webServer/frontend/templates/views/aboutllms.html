      <div class="llm-section">
        <h2>What Are LLMs</h2>
        <p>
          Large language models (LLMs) are systems that can understand and generate human language.
          They are a type of deep learning model that uses machine learning to analyze large amounts of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> They can perform many language tasks, like answering questions or summarizing text.
          They learn patterns from large datasets, making them powerful and versatile.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> They can sometimes produce incorrect or biased information if their training data is flawed.
          They require a lot of computing resources, which can make them expensive and energy-intensive.
        </p>

        <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
        <p>
          ChatGPT is a language model created by OpenAI. It is good at generating coherent text and having 
          detailed, context-aware conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> It can produce natural-sounding responses in many different topics, and adapts 
          well to context, making conversations feel more human-like.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> It may generate responses that sound confident but are actually incorrect, 
          and it depends on regular updates and careful monitoring to maintain quality.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="llm-section">
        <h2>Llama</h2>
        <p>
          Llama is a model developed by Meta AI. It has a flexible, smaller-footprint design that can handle 
          large-scale text tasks and give developers strong language capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Its smaller size can make it faster and more efficient than bigger models. 
          It can still handle a wide range of language tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> It may not perform as well as larger models on very complex tasks, and 
          developers might need to fine-tune it more to meet specific needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Gemini</h2>
        <p>
          Gemini, by Google, is an upcoming generative AI system that aims to include multi-modal features and 
          strong problem-solving skills, offering better context understanding and flexibility for complex tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> It plans to handle different types of data, such as text and images, in one system. 
          It focuses on deep problem-solving, which could help with challenging tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> It is not yet widely available, so its real performance is still unknown. 
          Multi-modal features may require more advanced hardware and data, making it more complex to use.
